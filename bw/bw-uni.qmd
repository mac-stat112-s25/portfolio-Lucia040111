title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "lightblue", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes", title = "A histogram for elevation")+
  theme_minimal()
```
