title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("cornflowerblue", "purple", "deeppink"))+
  labs(x = "Temperature at 9 am", y = "Temperature at 3 pm")+
  theme_minimal()
```
