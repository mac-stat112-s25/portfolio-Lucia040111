Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.35, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Republican support", fill = "historical voting trends", title = "Density plot for Republican support related to voting trends")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))+
  theme_minimal()
```
